# 42_push_swap

The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: 
Data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks.


This program calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest number of moves using Push_swap instruction language, that sorts the integer arguments received.
In this case, Ive used Sandwich algorithm (using only push, rotate and reverse rotate), which do less than 850 moves with 100 nums, and less than 8000 moves with less than 500 nums.
